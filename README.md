# MoreClocks
A practice React Native app that started as a way for me learn how to update components in real-time, and then got out of hand with weird types of clocks.

The first page that I worked on was just some basic digital display clocks, like the 12-hour and military 24-hour clocks. After that, the goofiness started to set-in, and I figured I could make a pointless 24-hour clock that counts down to 00:00 instead of 24:00. After that, I remembered that at one point in the late 1700s when France was starting to come up with the Metric system, they tried to implement a base 10 clock. That sounded like a fun and stupid kind of clock to add, so I quickly made a component for it and grouped it with the other ones I made.

The Face clock and Segmented clock were added as a way for me to practice drawing some more complex shapes on the screen and learning how to accurately update their positions. So even though they're basically the same, I was able to mess around with drawing more things on-screen with the Segmented clock.

Continuing with the weird clocks, the Weekday clock was one that I think I remember seeing in the background of one of the Harry Potter movies, so I figured why not remake it here?

For the Binary clock, I initially saw this type of design when I started watching Games Done Quick with my roommates in 2018. I noticed that the timer that they used for tracking the speedrunners' times used a binary display of the clock as a background detail that I found neat. To show an example, here is a video of one of my favorite speedruns where you can see the clock on the left-hand side of the screen.

Lastly, the Fibonacci Spiral clock and Fibonacci Color clock were both designs I found while browsing Reddit over the last couple of years, and they're based on the Golden Ratio. The spiral clock is a design that I personally think looks weirdly elegant, even though it's not exactly as accurate at displaying time as much as I would want it to. The color clock on the other hand is just flat-out weird and very difficult to actually tell the time. However, one of my friends in particular absolutely LOVES it. If I ever come back to this project in the future, one of the things I would like to do is find a way to make the Fibonacci Color clock into a widget that users can place on their phone's home screen.
